You're reading content on Chris Bredesen's personal web property.  I maintain this site as an altermative to posting longer form content on Facebook, and as a way to exercise my not-infrequent desire to write publicly.

Since I now know there are at least a few of us, I'm the Chris Bredesen from Florida, not the filmmaker from California or the guy in (I think) Tennessee. I lead technical development of Red Hat's Customer Portal and work remotely out of my home near Orlando.
