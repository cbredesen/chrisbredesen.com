You're reading content on Chris Bredesen's personal web property.  I maintain this site as an altermative to posting longer form content on Facebook, and as a way to exercise my not-infrequent desire to write publicly.

Since I now know there are at least a few of us, I'm the Chris Bredesen from Florida, not [one in LA](https://twitter.com/chrisbredesen) or the guy in (I think) Tennessee. I lead an engineering team at [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) where we focus on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](http://access.redhat.com). I work remotely out of my home in the Orlando area.
