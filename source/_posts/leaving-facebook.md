I'm not sure I ever trusted Facebook with my personal data but I have most of the time found enough value in its service to overlook the drawbacks. With news of the 2016 election influence and underhanded decisions by Facebook since then, I have decided to tip the scales the other way and leave the service.

A few articles worth reading:

  * [As Facebook Raised a Privacy Wall, It Carved an Opening for Tech Giants](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html)

  * [Facebook Is Giving Advertisers Access to Your Shadow Contact Information](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051)

  * [This awful article on Mashable that is probably almost as bad as Facebook but makes good points](https://mashable.com/2017/12/27/browser-bar-url-facebook-bad/#mhrrBLGNEmq2)

At the end of the day, I prefer an open web, free of inconsistent or heavy-handed editorial influence by companies like Facebook. That's not to say they aren't incredibly good at providing something the world needs - they are. But the cost has become too high. 

I recommend checking out [Time Well Spent](https://humanetech.com) or listening to Tristan Harris' [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_better_tech_could_protect_us_from_distraction?language=en).
