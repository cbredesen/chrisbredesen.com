Part of the reason I'm leaving Facebook is to spend more time on thoughtful content here on my site. I was never completely happy with the old theme but I left it in place for quite awhile. Recently I found Hueman and quite like its simplicity and performance. I've had to edit a few posts here and there and create a "logo" for the header but overall I'm pleased.

I will be evolving the site logo and logotype as part of my focus on the site so I'm hoping to improve it greatly.
