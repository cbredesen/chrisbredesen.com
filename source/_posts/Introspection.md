I've been thinking a lot about how to preserve some of my thoughts publicly and what form this site should take. My misadventures with WordPress on the now-defunct breddy.net left me with a bad taste in my mouth for PHP frameworks and I remain skeptical of publish-platform-as-a-service offerings like Medium, Tumblr and Facebook. Twitter is too limiting for reasonable discourse.

I love the format of [kottke.org](http://kottke.org) and I think he strikes an excellent balance between original thought and content filtering. Ditto for [daringfireball.net](http://daringfireball.net). Both reference other content in almost every post but wrap it in their own commentary without drowning out the original message. If I were to write full time, that'd be my target. [Tim Bray's blog](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) is usually informative and always comes across as authentic.

As for topic and scope, I don't think I want to limit myself. A working mission statement would have to call out the nature of what I feel inspired to write about; something that includes beliefs, ideas, actions and spans politics, technology and arts. That's wide open at this point.

But if I'm being honest, I'll probably never update this enough to make it worthwhile. Losing the whole of breddy.net really took the wind out of my online sails.
