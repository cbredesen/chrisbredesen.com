After what was probably the third or fourth battle with hacked WordPress installs, someone finally completely sunk breddy.net. I'm changing strategy and using static files in AWS.

The [setup](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html) is pretty easy but not fully automated. Amazon's offering is *extensive* and their pricing is incredible, even at low volume. I've moved this domain to Route 53 and will likely move others as well.

I think generally folks just use WordPress.com or Medium or something hosted but I am intrigued by rolling my own in AWS and it's been interesting exploring what their stack looks like. I will be doing more there in the future.
